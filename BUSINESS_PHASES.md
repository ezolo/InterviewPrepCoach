# Interview Prep AI – Business Roadmap Prompts

These prompts describe the product story you can give to an AI coworker when you want business-focused outcomes rather than technical to-do lists. Each phase highlights the customer value, the narrative, and the experience goals for that stage.

---

## Phase 1 – Launch the Core Interview Copilot
```
Imagine a user downloading Interview Prep AI for the first time. Help them upload their resume, compare it against a target job description, generate tailored interview questions, and tweak their AI provider settings with ease. Experience goals:
- The Profile Analysis flow should feel like a friendly recruiter walking through strengths and gaps, complete with a confidence score, matching skills, and immediate improvement ideas.
- The Questions Generator should feel like a coach who already knows the resume and job, producing thoughtful prompts plus discussion points in a single click.
- The Settings area should reassure the user that they stay in control: choose the AI brain they trust, test it, and proceed with confidence.
Emphasize delight, zero-friction onboarding, and a crisp Flet desktop experience that makes users feel “I can rely on this for my interviews.”
```

## Phase 2 – Turn Preparation into Daily Practice
```
Extend the experience from insight to action. The Practice hub should encourage users to rehearse answers in written, audio, or video form, showcasing strengths and gaps through rich AI feedback (scores, STAR method guidance, action items). The Writer studio becomes their personal content lab—generate resumes, cover letters, or cold emails informed by their professional story. Focus on consistency: the same voice, the same friendly guidance, the same sense that Interview Prep AI is their daily ally. Success looks like users saying, “This tool motivates me to practice and provides concrete improvements.”
```

## Phase 3 – Help Users Find and Track Opportunities
```
Shift from preparation to action in the job market. Through JSearch integration, deliver curated job results scored by fit to the user’s resume. Each listing should feel intentional: highlight why it fits, let the user save it, and funnel promising options directly into the Application Planner. The planner becomes a transparent pipeline that surfaces momentum (“where am I stuck?”) and next steps. Business emphasis: show measurable progress toward landing interviews by helping users balance search, applications, follow-ups, and wins.
```

## Phase 4 – Offer an Always-On Agentic Coach
```
Introduce the AI Career Coach as a mentor who remembers context, offers quick-hit advice, and guides long-term career planning. The experience should feel conversational, encouraging users to confide challenges, reflect on decisions, and act on personalized recommendations. Quick Advice buttons become “one-tap wisdom” on resume upgrades, interview strategy, job search, skills, and salary. Position this phase as transforming the product from a toolkit into an ongoing relationship where the AI proactively nudges users forward.
```

## Phase 5 – Deliver the Flagship Mock Interview Studio
```
Wrap the roadmap by showcasing a full-fledged mock interview command center. Users can spin up multi-format sessions (traditional, technical, behavioral, case), run through curated question flows, record responses, and receive a post-game report that feels like a seasoned interviewer’s debrief. Layer in finishing touches—stable recordings, exportable reports, polished UX, and reliability cues. The business promise: Interview Prep AI now supports the entire journey from self-awareness to real-time rehearsal, making it the definitive preparation companion.
